# medical-data-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of a medical dataset consisting of anonymous patient records.

The following analytics is built:

* Who is more likely to get sick in men or women?
* There are 2 age groups (conventionally aged and young people). Who gets sick more often and how much.
* Who gets sick earlier: men or women?
* Can we say that with an increase in the maximum heart rate, the likelihood of having a disease increases?

After that, a model was built to classify the presence of the disease.
